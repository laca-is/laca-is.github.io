</p>

The LaCA-IS is part of LaCA lab at [UTFPR - Campus Ponta Grossa](http://portal.utfpr.edu.br/campus/pontagrossa). 

We are mainly concerned with developing solutions towards problems involving transportation, like parking, trains, and vehicles.
 

## Scenarios of applications

* Smart Parking
* Autonomous Vehicles
* Urban Traffic Environment
* Trains


## Topics of interest

* Implementation of Agents and Multi-Agent Systems
* Formal Verification of Agents Multi-Agent Systems
* Case-based Reasoning
* Rational Agents
* Task Allocation
* Negotiation Protocols
* Embedded Agents

# Projects

* **MAPS** (_MultiAgent Parking System_):
> brief description: develop solutions based on Agents and Multi-Agent Systems for smart parking using JaCaMo framework.


* **Smart Parking**:
> brief description: this project is indeed an extension of MAPS project, where we shall join our efforts with researchers from [IPB - Portugal](http://ipb.pt). Here we also are mainly concerned with smart parking applications based on Agents and Multi-Agent Systems. Besides, we shall embed Agents into hardware systems in order to build some prototypes.

* **AVIA** (_Autonomous Vehicles with Intelligent Agents_):
> brief description: this project has a two-fold goal: 
>> 1. implement models for autonomous vehicles based on Intelligent Agents controlling the high-level functions which are used in the decision-making process (e.g. obstacle avoidance, autonomous control). Moreover, we are also interested in using formal verification towards the decision-making process of our Agents by using Model Checking for Agent Programming Languages (MCAPL)
>> 1. formalise the rules of the road for road junctions by using temporal logic; next, these rules should be embedded into Intelligent Agents (which model the behaviour of autonomous vehicles); and the behaviour of the Agents must be formally verified.
